            An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
            domestica).
          </li>

          <li>
            The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
            sieversii, is still found today.
          </li>
          <li>

            A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry –
            produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in
            the genus Musa.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called
            "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually
            elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a
            rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
